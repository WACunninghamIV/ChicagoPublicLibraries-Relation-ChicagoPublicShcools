# Week_13Project

Our group members, Walter, Jacqueline and myself uploaded a dataset about Chicago Public Libraries and public schools from the Chicago Data Portal where our team extracted the data, transformed our data to show the number of libraries in certain neighborhoods in comparison to the schools in the area, and loaded it into the database for viewing.  We created two tables of data in MongoDB and did an inner join on the variable in common in both tables.  If we had more time for this project, we wanted to explore if the amount of libraries in a neighborhood had any effect on school graduation rates and test scores.  This is something we will be able to explore in the future.
